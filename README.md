A configurable GUI application for managing digital stamp cards with automatic coupon assignment. Supports any API-compatible loyalty system.

## Features

- **Fully Configurable**: Customize API endpoints, stamps per card, reward coupons, and UI elements
- **Visual Stamp Card Display**: Interactive emoji stamps showing progress (customizable emojis)
- **Dynamic Layout**: Automatically adjusts to any number of stamps per card
- **Real-time Updates**: Fetch and update stamp card data via API

## How It Works

- **Partial Stamps**: Updates stamp count normally

- **Card Completion**: Increments cards filled and rewards earned counters
- **Configurable**: All settings (stamps per card, coupon IDs, etc.) are customizable

  },
  "ui": {
    "stamp_emoji": "‚òï",
    "empty_slot_emoji": "‚≠ï"
  }
}
```
